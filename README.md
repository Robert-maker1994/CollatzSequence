# Node.js Applicant Exercise

A starting point for a Node.js applicant exercise using a client/server setup.

## Description

This project provides a simple client & server application for use as a starting point for an applicant exercise.
The server is built using the Express web framework (https://expressjs.com/) while the client code is generated from the Create React App project (https://create-react-app.dev/).

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* Node.js v12 or later
* npm v7 or later

Install the server dependencies first by running the following command from the root folder

```bash

### Running the application
